# ideviceinstaller

*A command-line application to manage apps and app archives on iOS devices.*

## Features

The ideviceinstaller application allows interacting with the app installation
service of an iOS device.

It makes use of the fabulous [libimobiledevice library](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice) that allows
communication with iOS devices.

Some key features are:

- **Status:** Install, upgrade, uninstall, archive, restore and enumerate apps
- **Browse**: Allows to retrieve a list of installed apps with filter options
- **Install**: Supports app package, carrier bundle and developer .app directory
- **Format**: Allows command output in plist format
- **Compatibility**: Supports latest device firmware releases
- **Cross-Platform:** Tested on Linux, macOS, Windows and Android platforms

## Installation / Getting started

### Debian / Ubuntu Linux

First install all required dependencies and build tools:
```shell
sudo apt-get install \
	build-essential \
	checkinstall \
	git \
	autoconf \
	automake \
	libtool-bin \
	libplist-dev \
	libimobiledevice-dev \
	libzip-dev \
	usbmuxd
```

Continue with cloning the actual project repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/libimobiledevice/ideviceinstaller.git
cd ideviceinstaller
```

Now you can build and install it:
```shell
./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install
```

## Usage

First of all attach your device to your machine.

Then simply run:
```shell
ideviceinstaller --list-apps
```

This will print a list of `<appid>` identifiers (bundle identifiers) for use
with other commands (see further below).

To install an app from a package file use:
```shell
ideviceinstaller --install <file>
```

To uninstall an app with the `<appid>` from the device use:
```shell
ideviceinstaller --uninstall <appid>
```

Please consult the usage information or manual page for a full documentation of
available command line options:
```shell
ideviceinstaller --help
man ideviceinstaller
```
